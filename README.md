This is one of my journal publications.
 

Abstract: Nowadays, with the proliferation of different news sources, fake news detection is becoming a
crucial topic to research. Millions of articles are published daily in the press, on social media, and in electronic
media, and many of them may be fake. It is common for scammers to spread fake news to mislead people for
malicious purposes. For researchers to be able to evaluate fake news, it is necessary to understand its diversity,
how to study it, how to detect it, and its limitations. A descriptive literature review has been conducted
in this paper to identify more appropriate methodologies for analysing fake news. The review found two
broad classifications in the fake news research methodologies: fake news study perspectives and fake news
detection techniques. Based on our literature review, we suggest four perspectives to study fake news and
two major approaches to detecting it. Fake news can be studied in terms of knowledge, style, propagation and
source. In order to detect fake news, there are two major approaches: manually and automatically. There are
two types of manual fact-checks: expert-based and crowd-sourced. Automatic techniques are based mainly
on data science methods, specifically deep learning and machine learning. A machine learning-based method
was found to be more appealing when we evaluated all the automatic methods. Further research will focus
on investigating the efficacy of using Bayesian methods for detecting fake news statistically because it is a
flexible approach that allows for rapid updating of models in response to new data and has been successfully
applied to a wide range of problems across different domains.
